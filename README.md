# SpaceX Falcon 9 First Stage Landing Prediction ðŸš€

## Project Overview
In this capstone project, we aim to predict whether the Falcon 9 first stage will land successfully using machine learning models. SpaceX advertises the cost of launching a Falcon 9 rocket at $62 million, significantly lower than the costs charged by other providers ($165 million+). This cost reduction is primarily due to SpaceX's ability to reuse the first stage of the rocket. By predicting the likelihood of a successful landing, we can assess launch costs more accurately and provide insights for competitive pricing if another company were to bid against SpaceX.

## Learning Objectives
By the end of this project, you will have gained the following skills:

- **Data Manipulation**: Develop Python code to manipulate data in a Pandas DataFrame.
- **Data Conversion**: Convert JSON files into Pandas DataFrames.
- **Data Collection**: Collect data using SpaceXâ€™s API and web scraping techniques.
- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: Visualize and analyze the dataset to find key patterns.
- **Data Visualization**: Create interactive dashboards and maps using Plotly Dash and Folium.
- **Machine Learning**: Build predictive models using classification algorithms such as SVM, Classification Trees, and Logistic Regression to predict Falcon 9 landing success.

## Overview

### Data Collection and Preparation
- **Objectives**: Collect data using RESTful API and web scraping, and convert it into a Pandas DataFrame.
- **Activities**: Data wrangling to clean and prepare the dataset for analysis.

### Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
